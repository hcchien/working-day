          "description": "Scooter has been one of the most popular means of transportation for the ever busy city of Taipei. This is mainly due to the scarcity of land, high density of population, convenience, and affordability. Taiwan has a population of 23 million, of which the scooter users accounted about 14 million. This means that out of every two people, one of them would be a scooter commuter. This density ranks the highest in the world, and Taipei tops all cities in Taiwan. Therefore, the streets in Taipei are always busy and seemingly chaotic.\n\nMany first-time visitors to Taipei are astonished by the thousands of scooters on the streets. Since scooter is a relatively economical way to commute, the majority of scooter-base commuters are from middle- and low-income families. The images of scooters on the streets of Taipei, therefore, depict the most down-to-earth, daily life of Taipei citizens. There is no better way than looking closely at these images to learn how most people live in Taipei.\n\nScooter is also my primary transportation in Taipei. Therefore, this project truthfully represents my personal experience. It is noteworthy that this project was shot entirely with panoramic cameras. As a scooter commuter myself, I often see the fluid scenery through my helmet. The panoramic perspective may be the closest to what I have seen behind my helmet."
